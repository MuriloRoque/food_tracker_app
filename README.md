# What it does

- When the App is executed, you can create a new user by providing some personal information as: Name, e-mail, age, height, weight and activity level;
- Based on this info, the app calculates the amount of kilocalories you should eat per day ([references](https://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/bmr-formula.php));
- When logged in, the user can create groups of foods for control;
- The list of all created groups can be found by clicking on "All Groups" in the main menu;
- The main function of the app is to allow users to insert which food and the amount of they are eating throughout the day and tell them how many calories they still need to consume for that day OR how many calories did they eat more than recommended.
